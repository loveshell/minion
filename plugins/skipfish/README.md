Minion Skipfish Plugin
======================

This is a plugin for Minion that executes the Skipfish tool. It assumes Skipfish is installed on your system and that is is on the system PATH. It also expects Skipfish dictionaries to be installed in `/usr/share/skipfish/dictionaries`.

If you use Ubuntu, Debian, Redhat or Fedora you can simply install the `skipfish` package through `yum` or `apt-get`.
