    <p>The scanner is designed to bridge the gap between developers and security by allowing project development teams to scan their applications while they
    are still in development. This allows security flaws to be detected at the earliest stages and also introduces the team and project to the security
    lifecycle at the earliest point.</p>
    <p>To begin, either start a new project by clicking "New Scan" or open details about a previously used project or group project.</p>
